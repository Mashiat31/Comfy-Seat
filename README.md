## What is this?  
Driven to build a more comfortable seat cusion for elders who spend long hours on their wheel chair, we are combining 3D optical surface scanning and compliance probing to generate optimal 3D printable cusion designs to be fitted on seats. 
  
## Files
This project build upon multiple frameworks:  
Embedded System: STM32   
3D processing and mesh synthesis: openSCAD CLI for automatic 3D mesh generation   
Backbone: C++ is used to collect all the scanning and probing data and feed it to various subsystems  
Data visualization and communication with embedded system: Processing
